            <h1>Satinder Kaur</h1>
            <p class="tagline">Writer • Director • Storyteller</p>
            
            <p>By the time she was twelve, Sati had lived on three continents. Constantly adapting to new cultures was challenging, but she had one constant: movies.</p>
            
            <p>After high school, she wanted to study film, but when college felt financially out of reach, she did the only reasonable thing—she enlisted in the United States Army. Where else could she earn money for college to study filmmaking while also getting those elusive abs of steel? All was well for a while… until 9/11.</p>
            
            <p>She soon found herself in Baghdad, in the middle of a war she didn't particularly believe in. On the worst days, life unfolded like a Greek tragedy; on the best, it played as a dark comedy. It was there she learned the value of friendship, loyalty, and what it truly means to have someone's back—ideas that would later shape her storytelling.</p>
            
            <p>After her service, Sati earned her MFA in Directing from the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Today, she works as a television writer while building a career across film and television as a writer, director, and future showrunner.</p>
            
            <p>She is driven to leave her mark on the industry through stories shaped by lived experience and a distinct point of view. She lives in Los Angeles, pursuing big dreams—and very much still in the chase.</p>
