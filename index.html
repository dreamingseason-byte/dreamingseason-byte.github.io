            <h1>Satinder Kaur</h1>
            <p class="tagline">Writer • Director • Army Veteran</p>
            
            <p>By the time she was twelve, Sati had lived on three continents. Constantly adapting to new cultures was challenging, but she had one constant – her love for movies. So naturally, after high school she wanted to study film.</p>
            
            <p>But when college felt financially out of reach, she enlisted in the United States Army. How else could she earn money to pay for college to study film and get those elusive abs of steel?</p>
            
            <p>Then came 9/11, and the world changed. She soon found herself in Baghdad, in the middle of a war she didn't particularly believe in. On the worst of days, life unfolded like a Greek tragedy, and on the best, it felt like a dark comedy. It was there she learned the greatest weapon of war is fear – and that stories can both manufacture it and act as its antidote.</p>
            
            <p>After her deployment, Sati earned her MFA in Directing from the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Today, she works as a television writer while building a career across film and television as a writer, director, and a future showrunner.</p>
